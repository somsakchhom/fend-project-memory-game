# Memory Game Project

A simple game that you must attempt to match each pair of cards. Upon completion, your stats will be determined by how fast you complete it.

## Instructions

Flip over each card by clicking on them. If two cards do not match then they will turn over. Matched cards will remain face up. The game ends when all matched cards are found. Your score will be determined by how fast you complete the game.

## Thoughts, Ramblings...

This project was filled with many challenges. And I expect many more to follow. The greatest feeling is having those "Ah-Ha" moments! Because as soon as that happens the universe has a way to keep you humble.  As I continue my journey as a front-end web developer, I look forward to looking back at this and see where it all started.
